QUICK START GUIDE
=================

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO RUN
---------------------------

You MUST have at least ONE AI provider API key configured.

OPTION 1: OpenRouter (Recommended - Easiest)
---------------------------------------------

1. Sign up at https://openrouter.ai
2. Add payment method (pay as you go)
3. Generate API key
4. Add to .env:
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Cost: ~$0.10 per blog post with DeepSeek
Speed: Fast (30-60 seconds)
Setup: 5 minutes

OPTION 2: OpenAI
----------------

1. Sign up at https://platform.openai.com
2. Add payment method
3. Generate API key
4. Add to .env:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Cost: ~$0.50 per blog post with GPT-4o
Speed: Fast (30-60 seconds)
Setup: 5 minutes

OPTION 3: Anthropic Claude
--------------------------

1. Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com
2. Add payment method

4. Add to .env:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Setup: 5 minutes

OPTION 4: Google Gemini (Advanced)
-----------------------------------

Requires GCP project setup - more complex
See IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.txt for details

VERIFY SETUP
------------

After adding API key to .env:

1. Restart Flask app:
   python app.py

2. Look for these lines in console:
   ✓ OpenAI configured
   OR
   ✓ OpenRouter configured
   OR
   ✓ Anthropic configured

3. If you see at least one ✓, you're ready!

4. If you see:
   ⚠ WARNING: No AI providers configured
   
   Then your API key is not set correctly.

COMMON MISTAKES
---------------

1. API key not in .env file
   - Make sure file is named exactly ".env"
   - No spaces around the = sign
   - No quotes around the key

2. Forgot to restart app
   - Must restart after changing .env
   - Ctrl+C then python app.py

3. Invalid API key
   - Double check you copied entire key
   - Check key hasn't expired
   - Verify account has credits

TESTING
-------

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
2. Enter: "Create a post about AI trends"
3. Click "Generate Medium Post"
4. Wait 30-60 seconds
5. Should see blog post!

If you get error, check console for details.

OPTIONAL: Database (Not Required)
----------------------------------

App works WITHOUT database, but you won't have:
- Post history
- Analytics dashboard

To enable (optional):

1. Create Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Get anon key from Settings > API
3. Add to .env:
   SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_KEY=eyJxxx...

4. Run schema: See SUPABASE_SETUP.txt

WHAT WORKS WITHOUT DATABASE
----------------------------

✅ Generate blog posts
✅ View posts
✅ Copy/download
✅ Edit & regenerate
✅ All AI models
✅ Images
✅ SEO analysis

DATABASE ONLY FEATURES
-----------------------

📚 History page
📊 Analytics dashboard
🔍 Search posts

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
--------------------

START SIMPLE:
1. Add ONE AI provider key (OpenRouter easiest)
2. Generate test post
3. Make sure it works
4. Then add database if you want history

DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE:
- You don't need all providers
- You don't need Supabase
- Just one AI key is enough!

GET HELP
--------

If still stuck:

1. Check TROUBLESHOOTING.txt
2. Look at console errors
3. Verify .env file format
4. Make sure you restarted app

COST ESTIMATE
-------------

OpenRouter (DeepSeek): $0.10/post = $1 for 10 posts
OpenAI (GPT-4o): $0.50/post = $5 for 10 posts
Anthropic (Claude): $0.30/post = $3 for 10 posts

All are pay-as-you-go, no monthly fees.

NEXT STEPS
----------

After first successful post:

1. Try different templates
2. Experiment with tones
3. Test edit & regenerate
4. Export to Medium
5. Add database (optional)
6. Explore analytics (if DB added)

SUCCESS CHECKLIST
-----------------

✅ .env file exists
✅ At least one API key added
✅ App restarted
✅ Console shows "✓ [Provider] configured"

If all checked, you're good to go! 🚀
